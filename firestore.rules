# Notes:
# - Developer-only access to read all user documents should be done server-side using the Admin SDK with a service account. Do NOT allow client-side read of all /users documents.
# - If you need to allow admin users to read all documents from client-side, implement custom claims and check them here (not recommended without strong server controls).
